# Urban High-Speed Configuration Template
# Optimized for dense urban environments with fast message delivery - US 915MHz
# https://github.com/Nursedude/Meshtasticd_interactive_UI
#
# Use Case: City networks, dense node clusters, rapid messaging
# Frequency: 915MHz ISM band (902-928 MHz) - US Region
# Preset: ShortFast
# Features: Fast data rate, reduced congestion, low latency

Lora:
  # === GPIO Configuration ===
  # Adjust these for your specific hardware
  # Common defaults shown (MeshAdv-Mini/similar boards)

  # SPI Chip Select - GPIO 8 (Pin 24)
  CS: 8

  # Interrupt Request (DIO1) - GPIO 16 (Pin 36)
  IRQ: 16

  # Busy signal - GPIO 20 (Pin 38)
  Busy: 20

  # Reset pin - GPIO 24 (Pin 18)
  Reset: 24

  # === Radio Options ===
  # SX126x specific options (required for most modern LoRa modules)
  DIO2_AS_RF_SWITCH: true
  DIO3_TCXO_VOLTAGE: true

  # === Urban High-Speed Settings ===
  # Radio Parameters - ShortFast preset

  # Bandwidth: 250 kHz (wider = faster data rate)
  Bandwidth: 250

  # Spreading Factor: 7 (minimum = fastest but shortest range)
  # Perfect for dense urban areas with many nearby nodes
  SpreadFactor: 7

  # Coding Rate: 4/8 (maximum error correction)
  CodingRate: 8

  # Moderate power: 20 dBm (reduces interference in dense areas)
  TXpower: 20

  # Lower hop limit: 3 (reduces network congestion in dense urban mesh)
  HopLimit: 3

  # Default channel slot: 0
  # Can use different slots to separate urban networks
  ChannelNum: 0

Webserver:
  # Web interface port (443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
  Port: 443

# === Urban Network Channel ===
# Default public channel for urban mesh
Channels:
  - name: "Urban"
    psk: "AQ=="  # Public/default encryption key
    role: "PRIMARY"

# === Urban Deployment Notes ===
# - ShortFast is optimized for <1km range with fast message delivery
# - Ideal for cities with many nodes within line of sight
# - Lower power (20dBm) reduces interference with other nodes
# - Lower hop limit (3) prevents message flooding in dense networks
# - Consider using unique channel slots for different neighborhoods
