Lora:
  # === GPIO Configuration ===
  # Adjust these based on your specific FemtoFox hardware variant
  # Check your board documentation for exact GPIO mapping

  # SPI Chip Select - adjust for your board
  CS: 8

  # Interrupt Request (DIO1) - adjust for your board
  IRQ: 16

  # Busy signal - adjust for your board
  Busy: 20

  # Reset pin - adjust for your board
  Reset: 24

  # === Radio Options ===
  # Most FemtoFox boards use SX1262 or similar
  # Enable these for SX126x chips
  DIO2_AS_RF_SWITCH: true
  DIO3_TCXO_VOLTAGE: true

  # === Radio Parameters ===
  # FemtoFox works great with community standard settings
  # Uncomment and adjust these for custom modem presets:

  # Bandwidth in kHz (125, 250, 500)
  # Recommended: 250 for balanced performance
  # Bandwidth: 250

  # Spreading Factor (7-12)
  # Recommended: 10 or 11 for community networks
  # SpreadFactor: 11

  # Coding Rate (5-8 for 4/5 to 4/8)
  # Recommended: 8 for good error correction
  # CodingRate: 8

  # Transmit Power in dBm (check your hardware specs)
  # Typical range: 20-22 dBm
  # TXpower: 22

  # Hop Limit (0-7)
  # Recommended: 3 for most networks
  # HopLimit: 3

  # Channel Slot
  # Use slot 20 for MtnMesh compatibility
  # ChannelNum: 20

  # === SPI Configuration ===
  # SPISpeed: 2000000

GPS:
  # GPS configuration (if your FemtoFox has GPS module)
  # Check your board documentation for GPS serial port
  # Common options: /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyACM0
  # SerialPath: /dev/ttyS0

  # GPS enable pin (if applicable)
  # GPSEnableGpio: 4

I2C:
  # I2C bus for sensors and expansion modules
  I2CDevice: /dev/i2c-1

Webserver:
  # Web interface port
  # FemtoFox comes with pre-configured web apps
  Port: 443

# === Optional: MQTT Configuration ===
# Uncomment to enable MQTT for connecting to mesh networks
# MQTT:
#   Enabled: true
#   Server: mqtt.meshtastic.org
#   Port: 1883
#   Username: meshdev
#   Topic: msh/US/

# === Optional: Logging Configuration ===
# Logging:
#   LogLevel: info  # Options: debug, info, warn, error

# === Recommended Presets for FemtoFox ===
#
# MediumFast (recommended for community networks):
#   Bandwidth: 250, SpreadFactor: 10, CodingRate: 8, TXpower: 22
#   This is the MtnMesh community standard
#
# LongFast (for extended range):
#   Bandwidth: 250, SpreadFactor: 11, CodingRate: 8, TXpower: 22
#   Better range, slightly slower
#
# ShortFast (for dense urban areas):
#   Bandwidth: 250, SpreadFactor: 7, CodingRate: 8, TXpower: 20
#   Fastest data rate, shorter range

# === FemtoFox-Specific Features ===
# Foxbuntu OS comes pre-installed with:
# - Meshing Around: Auto-responder and BBS system
# - TheCommsChannel BBS: Community messaging system
# - Meshtastic Client: Web-based mesh interface
#
# Optional Hardware Modules:
# - Real-time clock (RTC) for accurate timekeeping
# - WiFi adapter for network connectivity
# - Additional sensors via I2C/GPIO

# === Network Integration ===
# For BBS hosting or community networks:
# 1. Use MediumFast preset for compatibility
# 2. Set channel slot to 20 (MtnMesh standard)
# 3. Configure appropriate hop limit (3-4)
# 4. Enable MQTT if connecting to internet gateway
#
# For standalone mesh node:
# 1. Use LongFast for maximum range
# 2. Configure GPS if available
# 3. Keep hop limit moderate (3)
# 4. Consider power consumption vs range needs
